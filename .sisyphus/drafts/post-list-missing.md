# Draft: Post List Missing (Only Search Input Visible)

## Requirements (confirmed)
- User reports: only search input visible; no post list content.
- Need plan to debug and fix.
- Provide minimal, safe fixes and verification steps.
- Must use existing HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks).
- Include likely root causes: file:// fetch restrictions, JS errors, rendering logic, CSS hiding.
- Output step-by-step plan and success criteria.

## Technical Decisions
- None yet.

## Research Findings
- Pending: codebase exploration.
- Pending: external best practices.

## Open Questions
- What is the current data source for posts (local JSON, API, embedded HTML)?
- How is the page being opened (file:// vs local server)?
- Any console errors visible when loading the page?
- Which browsers/environments are affected?

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: Debug plan, minimal fixes, verification steps for existing HTML/CSS/JS.
- EXCLUDE: Framework migrations or new libraries.
