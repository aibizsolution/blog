# Neobrutalism Design Basics

Neobrutalism is all about honesty in interface design. You see bold borders, hard shadows, high contrast colors, and layouts that feel physical and tactile.

This blog keeps the intensity moderate while still using the signature visual cues. It avoids soft gradients, blur, or overly delicate details.

Core traits to remember:
- Thick borders with sharp corners
- Hard, offset shadows (no blur)
- High contrast accents for emphasis

Example CSS:
```css
.neo-card {
  border: 3px solid #141414;
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 #141414;
}
```
