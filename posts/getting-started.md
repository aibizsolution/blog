# Getting Started with This Blog

This blog is a simple, static site designed to work anywhere without a build step. It is built with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it keeps everything in plain files.

The goal is to make content portable and reliable. Each post lives in its own Markdown file, while a small JSON index provides metadata for search and filtering.

Highlights in this setup:
- Pure static hosting with GitHub Pages
- No database or server required
- Lightweight, easy to maintain structure

Example snippet:
```html
<main class="container">
  <h1>Neobrutalism Blog</h1>
  <p>Built with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
</main>
```
